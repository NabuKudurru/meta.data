Title: Creates and Applies meta.data templates onto (sets of) variables
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Brett Buttliere
Maintainer: Brett Buttliere <brettbuttliere@gmail.com>
Description: This package contains the basic functions for creating meta.data 
    templates, editing them, writing them out, and applying them to other variables.
    It follows the recommendations in Buttliere (2021) on variable meta.data, and 
    the goal will be to create templates and make them available for commonly used 
    variables and scales, such that a person can search in repositories for 
    variables. 
    create.meta() creates a basic meta.data template which can be edited. 
    change.meta() changes an existing template, edit would have been better but 
    it already is a function, even if not a very good one. 
    write.meta() writes out the attributes (i.e., meta.data) to a template. 
    write.metas() does write.meta() for a range of variables. 
    apply.meta() applies a template to a variable. 
    apply.metas() applies a series of templates to a series of variables. Using 
    this function requires active thinking and checking to apply metas correctly. If
    the variables are not in the same order, for instance, you will apply the 
    templates incorrectly.
